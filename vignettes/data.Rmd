Some key data sets, for learning or general use have been included in the library. Access them using the `::` accessor:

```{r}
str(rcahelpr::hpsa_primarycare)
```

This means that we can use these data for a range of purposes, such as pairing them with other libraries and analyzing it:

```{r, fig.height=10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the graphing library ggplot2 and data management library dplyr
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)

# Wrangle some data to identify the average Health Professional Shortage Area 
# (HPSA) score in a given county:
demo <- rcahelpr::hpsa_primarycare %>%
  group_by(County_Equivalent_Name) %>%
  summarize(mean_hpsa_score = mean(HPSA_Score),
            total_hpsa_population = sum(HPSA_Designation_Population))

# Make a beautiful graph
ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_point(aes(x = total_hpsa_population , y = fct_rev(County_Equivalent_Name),
                 color = mean_hpsa_score)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0 , xend = total_hpsa_population ,
                   y = County_Equivalent_Name, yend = County_Equivalent_Name,
                   color = mean_hpsa_score)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Affected Populations in HPSA by County",
       subtitle = "HPSA scores determine priorities for the assignment of clinitians",
       caption = "Data from CCHS") +
  xlab("Total Population in all County HPSAs") +
  ylab("") +
  scale_color_gradient2(low="#F5F5DC", mid = "#FFA500", high="#8B0000", 
                        midpoint = mean(demo$mean_hpsa_score),
                        name = "Average County HPSA Score") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```

Also, the data and functions in this package can be combined:

```{r}
rcahelpr::make_codebook(input_df = rcahelpr::hpsa_primarycare, return_df = FALSE, 
              escape = FALSE)
```
